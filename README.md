<h2 id="introduccion">Introduction</h2>
<p>Work done in class by: María Lucía López López</p>
<p>Web project "from scratch" of the 1st evaluation of Markup Languages.</p>
<p>Diciembre de 2023 </p>

<h2 id="motivacion">Motivation</h2>
<p>I chose the theme because my cousin likes it and since I almost never give her things I wanted to make this about BTS for her, as I know it is a very special gift for her and I know she will always remember that moment.</p>

<h2 id="estructura">Structure</h2>
<p>The website is divided into 6 sections and the footer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beggining</li>  
  <li>History</li>
  <li>Awards</li>
  <li>Members</li>
  <li>Music Videos</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
  <li>Footer</li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Beggining</h3>
<img src="./bm.readme/beggining.png" alt="beggining image" style="width:50%">
<p>I have used a background image taken from the gettyimages page that easily adapts to different devices such as mobiles, pc and tablets.<br>
On it I have placed a Call to Action that I have styled from w3schools, since we have used in class most of there and it was easier for me, since I had worked with them more than once and the ones I saw in w3schools had most of them much less text than the ones in other websites, so the less code there is the less chances you have to make a mistake.<br></p>
<h3>Hisory</h3>
<img src="./bm.readme/history.png" alt="History" style="width:50%">
<p>I have arranged a grid of 2 columns in which the image and the explanatory text about the history of the BTS are divided.</p>
<h3>Awards</h3>
<img src="./bm.readme/awards.png" alt="Awards" style="width:50%">
<p>I have a grid of 4 four columns, two with images and two with text.</p>
<h3>Members</h3>
<img src="./bm.readme/members.png" alt="Members" style="width:50%">
<p>I have set up a grid with 4 columns of cards naming each of the members.</p>
<h3>Music Videos</h3>
<img src="./bm.readme/musicvideos.png" alt="Music Videos" style="width:50%">
<p>I have a grid with 4 columns and to add the videos I have used "iframe".</p>
<h3>Contact</h3>
<img src="./bm.readme/contact.png" alt="Contact" style="width:50%">
<p>In this section I have arranged a grid with two columns, one to put the address, phone number and email. And in the other column where I have put the map of the exact location of the BTS.</p>
<h3>Footer</h3>
<img src="./bm.readme/footer.png" alt="Footer" style="width:50%">
<p>In the footer I have added again the navigation bar so that when you get to the end you can select any option and it sends you back up to the section you want. I have also added the social networks and finally I have added below the navigation bar the disclaimer link.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<img src="./bm.readme/disclaimer.png" alt="Disclaimer" style="width:50%">

<h3>Script</h3>
<p>And finally I have put the javascript link at the end of the code because otherwise the footer columns were not working properly.</p>

<h3>Color palette</h3>
<p>90% purple, 5%black, 5%white</p>
